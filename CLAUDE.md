# Algebra 2 Interactives - Development Rules

## Design Rules

1. **Mobile Responsive**: All styles and layouts must work on cell phones. Use responsive CSS with appropriate media queries, flexible grids, and touch-friendly button sizes.

2. **Navigation**: Every page must have a way to navigate back to a higher level table of contents (e.g., section pages link back to chapter, chapter pages link back to home).

3. **Step-by-Step Practice**: Any time there is a multi-step operation, interactives should have students complete one step at a time, revealing the next step only after the current one is answered correctly.
